# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed a couple more lessons in the data analysis course. Trying and build a dropdown in my shopping list app using values from the database (so the item entries can be normalized) and finding every way that doesn't work. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but this is exceptionally difficult to accomplish in kivy using multiscreens.

**Thoughts**: Trying to figure things out with kivy is incredibly frustrating. I'm not sure if I'm not searching for the right things when trying to google the problem, or what it is, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to build the kivy dropdown I need, neither with spinners or dropdowns. It is incredibly frustrating to spend several hours trying to solve one problem and feeling like I'm stil exactly where I started when I opened up the editor today. Going to keep searching for some kind of solution.

### Day 1: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed a few more lessons in the freeCodeCamp 'Data Analysis with Python' course this morning. Got a couple of buttons working in my shopping list app.

**Thoughts:** Learning Kivy almost feels like learning a new language entirely. Getting working widgets isn't easy, but I'm getting there. Slighly confused on how to approach the subclasses of the Kivy objects vs. writing things in the .kv file. The next day I work on the project I'm going to try to build some dropdown lists, which will certainly be a challenge.
