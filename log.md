# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed a few more lessons in the freeCodeCamp 'Data Analysis with Python' course this morning. Got a couple of buttons working in my shopping list app.

**Thoughts:** Learning Kivy almost feels like learning a new language entirely. Getting working widgets isn't easy, but I'm getting there. Slighly confused on how to approach the subclasses of the Kivy objects vs. writing things in the .kv file. The next day I work on the project I'm going to try to build some dropdown lists, which will certainly be a challenge.
